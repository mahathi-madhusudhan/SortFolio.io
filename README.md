- **UI Library**: React or other JavaScript frameworks
- **Animation Library**: Framer Motion, anime.js, or any suitable animation library for smooth visualizations
- **Web Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge
- **Package Manager**: npm or yarn (for managing dependencies)
- **Version Control**: Git, with GitHub or GitLab for project collaboration

### Hardware Requirements
- **Minimum Processor**: Intel i3 or equivalent
- **RAM**: Minimum 4GB, recommended 8GB
- **Storage**: Minimum 500MB free disk space for installation and running
- **GPU**: Any standard GPU is sufficient for basic visualization tasks, though more advanced hardware may improve rendering

## 2. **Functional Requirements**

- **Visualization of Sorting Algorithms**: The system should visualize a variety of sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort).
- **Algorithm Selection**: Users can select different sorting algorithms to see how they work.
- **Array Customization**: Users can customize the array (size, range of values).
- **Speed Control**: Allow users to control the speed of the visualization.
- **Step-By-Step Visualization**: Option to proceed step-by-step through each sorting operation.
- **Automatic and Manual Modes**: Users can choose between automatic playback or manual (step-by-step) sorting.
- **Algorithm Details and Statistics**: Display time complexity and space complexity for each sorting algorithm.
- **User Instructions**: Provide clear instructions and explanations for each algorithm.

## 3. **User Interface Requirements**

- **Control Panel**: A control panel for selecting the algorithm, setting array size, controlling speed, and starting/stopping the visualization.
- **Display Area**: The main area where sorting is visualized, with each array element displayed as a bar or dot.
- **Algorithm Information Section**: Displays details of the selected algorithm (time and space complexity, description).
- **Responsive Design**: The interface should adapt to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Feedback and Status Indicators**: Show the current status (e.g., "Sorting in progress..." or "Sorting complete").

## 4. **Inputs and Outputs**

### Inputs
- **Array Elements**: Users can input the size of the array and the range of values.
- **Algorithm Selection**: User selection of a sorting algorithm (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort).
- **Speed Control**: User input to control the speed of sorting animations.

### Outputs
- **Visualization**: Display the sorting process in real time.

## 7. **Designing Test Cases**

### Test Cases

1. **Algorithm Execution Test**
   - **Function**: Ensures each sorting algorithm (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, etc.) sorts the array correctly.
   - **Expected Result**: The array should be in ascending order after the algorithm completes.

2. **Speed Control Test**
   - **Function**: Checks if adjusting the speed slider impacts the speed of the visualization.
   - **Expected Result**: Visualization speed should change according to the selected speed.

3. **Array Customization Test**
   - **Function**: Verifies that changing the array size and value range works correctly.
   - **Expected Result**: Array adjusts according to user-defined size and range, and no values exceed limits.

4. **Algorithm Selection Test**
   - **Function**: Ensures that selecting different algorithms updates the visualization accordingly.
   - **Expected Result**: The selected sorting algorithm's visualization should match the expected sorting process.

5. **UI Responsiveness Test**
   - **Function**: Confirms that the application layout adapts well across screen sizes.
   - **Expected Result**: The app should display and function properly on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

6. **Step-By-Step Visualization Test**
   - **Function**: Tests the step-by-step mode to see if users can proceed through each sorting step manually.
   - **Expected Result**: Each "next" action shows the subsequent step in the sorting algorithm.

7. **Error Handling Test**
   - **Function**: Tests that the application handles unexpected inputs or actions gracefully.
   - **Expected Result**: Errors are caught and handled without crashing the app, displaying an appropriate message.

## 8. **Future Work**

1. **Additional Algorithms**: Implement more complex algorithms such as Radix Sort, Heap Sort, and Tim Sort.
2. **Adaptive Array Types**: Provide options for users to visualize sorting with different data types (e.g., strings, objects).
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Add features to compare algorithms side-by-side on the same dataset.
4. **3D Visualization**: Introduce 3D visualizations to make the experience more engaging.
5. **Save and Load Sessions**: Allow users to save specific settings and load them later.
6. **Enhanced User Analytics**: Collect anonymized user data to improve user interface and experience.
7. **Performance Optimization**: Enhance performance for larger arrays or more complex visualizations.
8. **Interactive Tutorials**: Provide guided steps and explanations within the app for a more educational experience.
