## Project Structure

| **Tasks** | **Objectives** | **Outcomes** |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| **Task 1**: Setting Up the Development Environment | Objective: Familiarize students with the initial setup process, including installing necessary dependencies for Next.js and Tailwind CSS. | Outcome: Students should have a functional development environment with all required packages installed and configured. |
| **Task 2**: Building the Sorting Visualizer Interface | Objective: Implement a user interface that allows users to select different sorting algorithms and view sorting steps visually. | Outcome: A responsive and interactive interface where users can choose sorting algorithms and control the visual playback speed. |
| **Task 3**: Implementing Sorting Algorithms | Objective: Implement sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort) and connect them to the visualizer. | Outcome: Functional algorithms that can be visualized on the interface in real-time. |
| **Task 4**: Testing and Debugging | Objective: Ensure the application works as expected by testing each algorithm and UI functionality. | Outcome: A bug-free, smooth, and user-friendly experience where users can see each algorithm's functionality without issues. |
| **Task 5**: Deploying the Application on Vercel | Objective: Guide students through deploying their project to Vercel, making it accessible online. | Outcome: A live URL where the sorting visualizer project is accessible to the public. |

## Key Learning Outcomes

By the end of this project, students will be able to:

- Set up and configure a project using Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS.
- Create a user interface that facilitates the visualization of different sorting algorithms.
- Implement sorting algorithms and connect them to a visualizer interface.
- Test, debug, and deploy a fully functioning web application on Vercel.

## Instructions for Completion

1. **Setting Up**: Follow Task 1 to configure your development environment. Ensure you have the latest versions of Node.js, npm, and the necessary libraries.
2. **Building UI**: Use React components and Tailwind CSS to build the sorting visualizer interface.
3. **Implementing Algorithms**: Write sorting algorithm functions in JavaScript. Test them within the visualizer to confirm they display each sorting step correctly.
4. **Testing and Debugging**: Run through the interface, trying different algorithms and settings to ensure everything works as expected.
5. **Deployment**: Use Vercel to deploy your application, ensuring itâ€™s available for public access.
