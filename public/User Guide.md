# 🎉 Welcome to SortFolio.io! 🎉

## What’s This All About?

Imagine a world where sorting algorithms dance to your tune. **SortFolio.io** is here to bring sorting algorithms to life! In this project, we’ll create a visual playground to show just how cool sorting can be. If you've got a handle on JavaScript and want to dive into **Next.js**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS**—and have fun doing it—you’re in the right place.

**Time to Complete:** 15 hours (or faster if you skip a few snacks, but who wants that?)

---

## The Gear You’ll Need 🖥️

Before we dive in, here’s your toolkit checklist. Don’t worry, we’re not assembling IKEA furniture here, but make sure you’re set up with:

### Software
- **Code:** JavaScript (with React and Next.js for structure)
- **Look & Feel:** Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Animations:** Framer Motion or anime.js for smooth moves
- **Browser:** Chrome, Firefox, or Edge
- **Package Manager:** npm or yarn (your call)
- **Version Control:** Git (because undoing in real-time is magic)

### Hardware
- **Processor:** Intel i3 (or more muscle if you’ve got it)
- **RAM:** 4GB at least, 8GB recommended (no one likes laggy visuals)
- **Disk Space:** Just 500MB; this isn’t Call of Duty.
- **GPU:** Any ol' graphics card should do fine.

Hey! I’m **Mahathi Madhusudhan Rao**, your friendly neighborhood tech trainer with **3 years of experience** in teaching and (occasionally) wrestling code into submission. I specialize in **C, C++, Java, and DSA**—you know, all the stuff that makes computers run and brains hurt.

I kicked things off at **FacePrep** and then joined **PrepBytes**, where I got to be one of the core team members. There, I wrote tech articles, made the website prettier, and helped build the frontend so smooth it should come with a warning label. Oh, and I’ve trained over **2000+ students** in things like **Full Stack Development, Networking, and Linux OS**. (Yes, Linux! And no, it’s not as scary as it sounds—promise.)

With a **B.Sc. in Computer Science** and an **MBA in IT and Project Management**, I’ve got the mix of nerdiness and organization skills to keep us moving and coding. When I’m not deep in dev or teaching mode, you’ll find me cooking up something (hopefully) edible or singing way too loud. It keeps life balanced!

So, if you’re ready to learn the tech ropes and maybe laugh a bit along the way, let’s make this coding thing as fun as possible.

## Let’s Do This! 🚀

It’s time to bring SortFolio.io to life. Get your favorite drink, settle in, and let’s make sorting algorithms look awesome. The journey’s about to begin, and this isn’t your average project—this is SortFolio.io, where algorithms meet fun, and you’re the mastermind behind it all. 👏

# Step-by-Step Guide to Building SortFolio.io

Welcome to **SortFolio.io**, where sorting meets style! Follow these steps, and soon you'll have an interactive sorting visualizer up and running.

## 1. Project Setup 🚀

### Step 1: Create the Project
- **Open your terminal** and create a new Next.js project:
  ```bash
  npx create-next-app sortfolio --typescript
  cd sortfolio
  ```
- **Install Tailwind CSS** for easy styling:
  ```bash
  npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
  npx tailwindcss init -p
  ```

### Step 2: Configure Tailwind CSS
- Open `tailwind.config.js` and set up paths for purging unused CSS:
  ```js
  module.exports = {
    content: [
      "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
      "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    ],
    theme: {
      extend: {},
    },
    plugins: [],
  };
  ```
- Import Tailwind into `styles/globals.css`:
  ```css
  @tailwind base;
  @tailwind components
  ```markdown
---

## 2. Build the Interface 🖌️

### Step 1: Create Components for the Visualizer
- Inside the `components` folder, create two key components: `SortingVisualizer.tsx` and `ArrayBar.tsx`.

#### ArrayBar.tsx
- This component represents individual bars in the array to be sorted.
- **Example code**:
  ```tsx
  import React from 'react';

  interface ArrayBarProps {
    height: number;
    color: string;
  }

  const ArrayBar: React.FC<ArrayBarProps> = ({ height, color }) => (
    <div style={{ height: `${height}px`, backgroundColor: color }} className="w-2 mx-0.5"></div>
  );

  export default ArrayBar;
  ```

#### SortingVisualizer.tsx
- The main component to house the sorting animation and handle state.
- **Start with a simple structure**:
  ```tsx
  import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
  import ArrayBar from './ArrayBar';

  const SortingVisualizer: React.FC = () => {
    const [array, setArray] = useState<number[]>([]);

    useEffect(() => {
      resetArray();
    }, []);

    const resetArray = () => {
      const newArray = Array.from({ length: 50 }, () => Math.floor(Math.random() * 300) + 5);
      setArray(newArray);
    };

    return (
      <div className="flex justify-center items-end mt-8">
        {array.map((value, idx) => (
          <ArrayBar key={idx} height={value} color="blue" />
        ))}
      </div>
    );
  };

  export default SortingVisualizer;
  ```

---

## 3. Add Sorting Algorithms ⚙️

### Step 1: Implement Algorithms
- Inside `components`, create a new folder called `algorithms` and add files for each sorting algorithm you want to include, such as `bubbleSort.ts`, `quickSort.ts`, and `mergeSort.ts`.

#### Example: bubbleSort.ts
- Create a basic bubble sort function:
  ```typescript
  export const bubbleSort = (array: number[]) => {
    const animations = [];
    const arr = array.slice();

    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
      for (let j = 0; j < arr.length - i - 1; j++) {
        animations.push([j, j + 1]);
        if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
          animations.push([j, j + 1, true]);
          [arr[j], arr[j + 1]] = [arr[j + 1], arr[j]];
        } else {
          animations.push([j, j + 1, false]);
        }
      }
    }

    return { animations, sortedArray: arr };
  };
  ```

### Step 2: Integrate with the Visualizer
- Import your sorting algorithm in `SortingVisualizer.tsx` and link it with the visualizer.

#### SortingVisualizer.tsx (continued)
  ```tsx
  import { bubbleSort } from './algorithms/bubbleSort';

  const startSorting = () => {
    const { animations } = bubbleSort(array);
    animateSorting(animations);
  };

  const animateSorting = (animations: any[]) => {
    animations.forEach((animation, index) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        // animation logic goes here
      }, index * 100);
    });
  };
  ```

---

## 4. Add Controls 🎛️

### Step 1: Create Control Buttons
- Inside `SortingVisualizer.tsx`, add buttons to reset the array, start sorting, and choose sorting algorithms.

  ```tsx
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
      <div className="flex space-x-4 mb-4">
        <button onClick={resetArray} className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded">Reset Array</button>
        <button onClick={startSorting} className="px-4 py-2 bg-green-500 text-white rounded">Start Sorting</button>
      </div>
      <div className="flex justify-center items-end mt-8">
        {array.map((value, idx) => (
          <ArrayBar key={idx} height={value} color="blue" />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
  ```

---

## 5. Add Styling and Animation 🎨

### Step 1: Style Array Bars
- Use Tailwind to give your array bars a sleek look:
  ```css
  .array-bar {
    transition: height 0.3s ease;
  }
  ```

### Step 2: Animate Sorting
- Inside the `animateSorting` function, update array bar colors to create a visual effect when two elements are compared and swapped.

  ```tsx
  const animateSorting = (animations: any[]) => {
    animations.forEach((animation, index) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        const [barOneIdx, barTwoIdx, isSwap] = animation;
        // Update bar colors and height here
      }, index * 100);
    });
  };
  ```

---

## 6. Deployment 🚀

- **Deploy to Vercel** for a quick and easy hosting solution:
  ```bash
  vercel
  ```
- Follow the prompts to deploy your application, and soon you'll have **SortFolio.io** live!
